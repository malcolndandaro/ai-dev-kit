Hi claude i have been thinking if we should also install a default CLAUDE.md with our project.
If someone installs our project means they will use databricks and so the MCP server and skills should be used for most things instead of general knowledge.
I have beeen thinking if we deploy a CLAUDE.md with our project installtion if this will improve the ratio of how a invokable skill or mcp is against general knowledge.
I need you to deploy a agent team, research the web in parallel and analyze if that makes sense, after the analyzes, build a draft CLAUDE.md

Let me know any questions
